# B. Levi - Full-Stack Systems Engineer and Automation Architect

Most of my active projects are self-hosted on a private Gitea instance for control, speed, and stealth. You can self-host too! it's easier than you think.

## About

I build layered systems that think, click, scrape, respond, analyze, and perform tasks in the real world.

I'm a full-stack engineer focused on creative and operational automation using LLMs, browser control, and end-to-end data pipelines. My work blends technical depth with real-world execution, always aiming for one thing: the reduction of repetitive annoying tasks.

## Specialties

- Human-like agents that can use data to perform real actions across infrastructure.
- Autonomous LLM workflows that write reviews, generate emails, reply to threads, and summarize chaos
- Structured data logging to Supabase, vector DBs, and APIs for insight, analytics and control.
- Creative automation: Reddit-to-Shorts video pipelines, fake influencer networks, lead scraping.
- Full ETL and ops systems for eCommerce, marketing, and internal tools
- Self-hosted, modular infrastructure for maximum control (and zero rate limits!)

## Current Focus Areas

- LLM agent systems with FastAPI layers, Slack triggers, Ollama brains, and OpenWebUI Integration for a beautiful frontend solution.
- Content intelligence for YouTube and Reddit: harvesting, summarizing, and remixing for trend maps 
- Automated persona networks that simulate users across platforms for marketing or analysis
- Ai Agent that run full workflows with one command â€” from data scraping to lead scoring to respond to angry customer emails.
- eCommerce tools that generate batch product changes, clean catalogs, and plug into the most common CRMS such as, Klaviyo, and Shopify
- Infra that just works: Postgres, Docker, Ollama, Gitea, WireGuard

## Stack 

- Languages: Python, Bash, JavaScript, SQL
- Tools: FastAPI, Playwright, ffmpeg, Supabase, Ollama
- Automation: Firefox + extensions, Incognition, ADB, cron, systemd
- Infra: Docker Compose, Tailscale, Gitea, local Ollama
- Data: PostgreSQL (Supabase), local vector DBs, SQLite session cache
- Ops: ETL pipelines, webhook services, Telegram interfaces, API sync
